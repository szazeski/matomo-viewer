# matomo-viewer

The open-source website analytic tool matomo makes it difficult to view event data, 
so this simple JS report uses the live API to pull event data and place in a DataTable 
with some replacement options and search capabilities.

- Local storage of api key, server url, replacements
- Searchable and sortable table
- Text replacement
- Columns
  - Date
  - User GUID or Visitor ID
  - Event Category
  - Event Action
  - Event Value
